# Terraform-learnings

## Consideration
- RDS publicly accessible is not recommended.
- update allowed_cidr_block = "181.115.208.249/32" with your public ip
- create imports.tf file for importing existing resources

## Commands
- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
- terraform destroy # to destroy the resources
